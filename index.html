								Hi! I'm Naylynn, a sophomore at Smith College and Ada Comstock Scholar. <br> <br>
								
								As a member of the Latinx community, I'm passionate about the intersection of culture and science, 
								educational accessibility, and diversity of thought in the scientific process. <br> <br>
								
								Besides studying, I also enjoy playing video games and searching for planets outside of our Solar System. <br> <br>

								<b>Outreach</b><br>
								As a member of the BRIEF Astronomy Program, I mentored research groups from the initial proposal stage to journal publication. <br>
								<br>
								Additionally, while working for the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, I led outreach efforts for her research team while in Perú during the 2019 solar eclipse in South America.  
								This included giving an hour-long talk in Spanish at the Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería to the local community. Additionally, I spoke with the local media, 
								embassy officials and local scientists who visited us at the local military base to see our instrument which was mounted on an airplane. 
								We then had a front-page story on the local paper regarding our scientific study.

							<p>
								<b>Equity & Inclusion</b><br>
								While attending community college at San Diego Mesa College, I served as a chapter president for SACNAS (Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science).
								Our group of students formed a support system and met regularly for study sessions and networking events. I organized informations sessions
								regarding research programs, writing professional and personal statements and graduate school.
